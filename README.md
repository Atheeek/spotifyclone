# Simple Spotify Clone
 

## ✨ About The Project

The Simple Spotify Clone is a web-based music streaming application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates core functionalities of a music player, providing users with an engaging and seamless music experience directly in their browser. This project serves as a demonstration of building interactive web applications with fundamental front-end technologies.


## 🚀 Features

* **User Interface (UI):** A visually appealing and responsive design that mimics aspects of a music player layout.
* **Music Playback:** Play, pause, and (optionally, if implemented) skip tracks with smooth controls.
* **Playlist/Track Handling:** Ability to select and play from a pre-defined set of tracks or a simple playlist structure.
* **Progress Bar & Seek Functionality:** Allows users to visually track song progress and (if implemented) navigate through songs effortlessly by clicking/dragging the bar.
* **Volume Control:** Adjust volume levels dynamically.
* **Responsive Design:** Works across different screen sizes and devices for a consistent user experience.


## 💻 Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Provides the basic structure and layout of the web pages.
* **CSS:** Handles the styling for a modern, visually appealing, and interactive user interface.
* **JavaScript:** Controls interactivity, manages audio playback, updates the UI dynamically, and handles user input for controls like play/pause, volume, and seeking.


## 🛠️ Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[Your-GitHub-Username]/[Your-Repo-Name].git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file, or by using a command like:
    ```bash
    start index.html # On Windows
    open index.html  # On macOS
    xdg-open index.html # On Linux
    ```
    *Alternatively, you can serve the files using a simple local web server for better practice, especially if dealing with certain browser restrictions or future expansions.*


## 🏃 Usage

[Explain how a user interacts with the running application.]

* Open the `index.html` file in your browser as described in the installation steps.
